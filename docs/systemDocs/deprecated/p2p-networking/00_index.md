# P2P Networking in Accumulate

This directory contains documentation about peer-to-peer (P2P) networking in the Accumulate network.

## Overview

P2P networking is a fundamental component of the Accumulate network architecture, enabling nodes to communicate directly with each other without relying on central servers. This documentation covers the concepts, implementation details, and testing strategies for P2P networking in Accumulate.

## Contents

1. [Multiaddress Construction](./01_multiaddress_construction.md) - How multiaddresses are constructed and used in the P2P network
2. [Network Initiation Test Plan](./02_network_initiation_test_plan.md) - Test plan for network initiation in the P2P network
3. [Multiaddress Validation Tests](./03_multiaddress_validation_tests.md) - Tests for validating multiaddresses

## Key Aspects

- **Multiaddress Format** - The format and structure of multiaddresses used in the P2P network
- **Peer Discovery** - How nodes discover and connect to peers in the network
- **Network Topology** - The structure and organization of the P2P network
- **Connection Management** - How connections between peers are established and maintained
- **Testing and Validation** - Strategies for testing and validating P2P networking functionality
