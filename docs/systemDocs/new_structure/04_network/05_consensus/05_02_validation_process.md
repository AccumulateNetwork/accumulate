# Transaction Processing Deep Dive - Part 2: Validation Process

This document details the validation process for transactions in Accumulate.

## CheckTx Validation

When a transaction is submitted to the network, it undergoes initial validation in the CheckTx phase:

1. **Syntax Validation**
   - Verify transaction format and structure
   - Check required fields are present
   - Validate signature format

2. **Semantic Validation**
   - Verify account existence
   - Check authorization and permissions
   - Validate transaction parameters
   - Verify sufficient token balance for transfers

3. **State-Based Validation**
   - Check sequence numbers
   - Verify account state allows the operation
   - Validate against current network parameters

## Validation Outcomes

The validation process can result in several outcomes:

- **Accept**: Transaction passes all validation checks
- **Reject**: Transaction fails validation and is rejected
- **Pending**: Transaction requires additional information or conditions
- **Delay**: Transaction is valid but should be processed later

## Validation Context

Validation occurs in different contexts with varying requirements:

- **Mempool Validation**: Quick checks before adding to mempool
- **Consensus Validation**: More thorough validation during consensus
- **Cross-Chain Validation**: Validation across multiple chains

## Error Handling

The validation process includes robust error handling:

- Detailed error codes and messages
- Classification of errors (permanent vs. temporary)
- Suggestions for resolving validation issues
- Logging for debugging and monitoring

## Performance Considerations

Validation is optimized for performance:

- Caching of validation results
- Early termination on failure
- Parallel validation where possible
- Prioritization based on transaction type
