# Peer Discovery in Accumulate

This directory contains documentation about the peer discovery mechanisms used in Accumulate.

## Overview

Peer discovery is a critical component of the Accumulate network that enables nodes to find and connect to other nodes in the network. This process is essential for maintaining network connectivity, resilience, and performance.

## Contents

1. [Implementation Summary](./01_implementation_summary.md) - A high-level overview of the peer discovery implementation in Accumulate
2. [Detailed Implementation](./02_detailed_implementation.md) - In-depth details about the peer discovery implementation
3. [Network Initiation Analysis](./03_network_initiation_analysis.md) - Analysis of how peer discovery works during network initialization

## Key Concepts

- **Network Topology**: The structure of the Accumulate network, including BVNs and the DN
- **Peer Discovery**: The process by which nodes find and connect to other nodes in the network
- **Network Initialization**: The process of bootstrapping the network and establishing initial connections
- **Multiaddress Construction**: How node addresses are constructed and used in the P2P network
