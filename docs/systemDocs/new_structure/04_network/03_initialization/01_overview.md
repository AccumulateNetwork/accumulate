## Overview

Network initialization is a critical component of the Accumulate debug tools, responsible for creating a comprehensive model of the network that supports anchor healing, synthetic healing, monitoring, and performance analysis.

## Core Concepts

1. [Design Document](./design.md): Comprehensive design document for network initialization
2. [URL Construction](../url-construction.md): Guide to URL formats and construction
3. [Defensive Programming](../error-handling.md): Best practices for error handling and nil pointer prevention

## Key Topics

### Version Retrieval

Proper version retrieval is essential for accurate network status reporting. The recommended approach is to use the v2 API and properly handle the nested response structure:

```go
// Query the version using the v2 API
resp, err := client.Version(ctx)
if err != nil {
    return err
}

// Extract the version from the response
var versionResp struct {
    Version string `json:"version"`
}

// Marshal the Data field to JSON and then unmarshal it into the struct
data, err := json.Marshal(resp.Data)
if err != nil {
    return err
}

err = json.Unmarshal(data, &versionResp)
if err != nil {
    return err
}

// Use the version information
fmt.Println("Version:", versionResp.Version)
```

### URL Format Compatibility

Different components require different URL formats:

- **Sequence Operations**: Use raw partition URLs (e.g., `acc://bvn-Apollo.acme`)
- **Anchor Healing**: Use anchor pool URLs with partition ID (e.g., `acc://dn.acme/anchors/Apollo`)

It is critical to respect these format differences and not attempt to standardize them, as this would break compatibility with the network.

### Nil Pointer Prevention

To prevent nil pointer dereferences, always implement defensive programming techniques:

1. Check for nil responses before accessing their methods or fields
2. Verify that required components are available before using them
3. Use panic recovery to catch unexpected nil pointer dereferences
4. Provide detailed error messages to aid in debugging

## Best Practices

1. **Respect URL Format Requirements**: Use the specific URL format required by each component
2. **Implement Defensive Programming**: Always check for nil responses and handle errors gracefully
3. **Use Proper Concurrency**: Use mutexes and promises to handle concurrent operations
4. **Set Appropriate Timeouts**: Use context with timeouts for network operations
5. **Implement Retry Logic**: Use exponential backoff for retrying failed operations
6. **Provide Detailed Logging**: Log detailed information for debugging
