## 1. Introduction

This section documents the core components of the Accumulate blockchain protocol. These components form the foundation of the system and are essential to understanding how Accumulate works.

## 2. Available Sections

### [01. URL System](./01_url_system/)
Documentation on Accumulate's URL-based addressing system, which provides a hierarchical and human-readable way to identify accounts and resources.

### [02. Merkle Trees](./02_merkle_trees/)
Information on how Merkle trees are implemented and used for efficient data verification in Accumulate.

### [03. Snapshots](./03_snapshots/)
Documentation on the snapshot system used for state persistence and recovery.

### [04. Healing](./04_healing/)
Details on the healing process that ensures data consistency across the network.

## 3. Component Interactions

The core components of Accumulate work together to provide a robust and efficient blockchain platform:

- The **URL System** provides the addressing framework for all accounts and resources
- **Merkle Trees** enable efficient verification of data and state
- **Snapshots** provide a mechanism for state persistence and recovery
- The **Healing** process ensures data consistency across the network

## 4. Design Philosophy

The design of Accumulate's core components follows several key principles:

- **Hierarchical Structure**: Components are organized in a hierarchical manner
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each component has a specific responsibility
- **Scalability**: Components are designed to scale with the network
- **Resilience**: Components include mechanisms for recovery and healing
