# Future Development Plans

This section outlines the planned enhancements and future features for the Accumulate network. These documents describe designs and implementation plans for features that are not yet implemented but are being considered for future versions of the protocol.

## Contents

1. [List Proofs for Anchors](01_list_proofs_for_anchors.md) - Implementation plan for using list proofs to efficiently handle anchors
2. [Enhanced List Proofs for Sequenced Transactions](02_enhanced_list_proofs.md) - Design for using list proofs for transaction ordering
3. [Transaction Exchange Between Partitions](03_transaction_exchange.md) - Improved methods for transaction exchange between network partitions

## Purpose

The purpose of this section is to document design considerations and implementation plans for future features. These documents serve as:

1. **Design References** - Technical specifications and design decisions for planned features
2. **Implementation Guides** - Detailed implementation plans for developers
3. **Roadmap Documentation** - Part of the overall development roadmap for Accumulate

## Status

The features described in this section are in various stages of planning and design. They are not yet implemented in the current version of Accumulate but represent the direction of future development.

Each document includes information about the current status of the feature, expected benefits, implementation challenges, and integration considerations.
