# Anchor Proofs and Receipts Overview

This document provides an overview of the anchor proofs and receipts system in Accumulate.

## Introduction

Anchor proofs and receipts are fundamental components of the Accumulate blockchain system, providing cryptographic verification of transaction inclusion and cross-chain communication.

## Key Concepts

- **Anchor**: A cryptographic commitment of one blockchain's state that is recorded in another blockchain
- **Proof**: A cryptographic verification that a transaction or data was included in a block
- **Receipt**: A document containing the proof and metadata necessary for verification

## Purpose

Anchor proofs and receipts serve several critical purposes in Accumulate:

1. Verifying transaction inclusion without requiring the entire blockchain
2. Enabling secure cross-chain communication
3. Supporting the hierarchical blockchain architecture
4. Providing cryptographic finality guarantees
