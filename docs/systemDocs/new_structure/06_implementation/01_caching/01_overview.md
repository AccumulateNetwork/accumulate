# Caching Strategies in Accumulate

This directory contains documentation about caching strategies and implementations in the Accumulate network.

## Overview

Caching is an essential technique for improving performance and reducing load on the network. This documentation covers the concepts, strategies, and implementations of caching across different versions of the Accumulate system.

## Contents

1. [Caching Concepts](./01_concepts.md) - Fundamental concepts and principles of caching in Accumulate
2. [Caching Implementation v2](./02_implementation_v2.md) - Caching strategies in version 2 of the implementation
3. [Minimal Caching v3](./03_minimal_caching_v3.md) - Minimal caching approach in version 3
4. [Address Caching v4](./04_address_caching_v4.md) - Address-specific caching in version 4

## Key Aspects

- **Cache Invalidation** - Strategies for determining when cached data is no longer valid
- **Cache Coherence** - Ensuring consistency between cached data and the underlying data
- **Memory Management** - Efficiently managing memory usage in caches
- **Performance Optimization** - Using caching to improve system performance
- **Distributed Caching** - Caching strategies in a distributed network environment
