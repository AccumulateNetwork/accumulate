## 3. Implementation Overview

Accumulate's signature system is designed to be:

- **Flexible**: Supporting multiple signature types and verification methods
- **Secure**: Ensuring robust validation of all signatures
- **Interoperable**: Compatible with other blockchain ecosystems
- **Extensible**: Allowing for new signature types to be added

The implementation follows a modular approach, with separate components for different aspects of signature processing and validation.

## 4. Key Components

- **Signature Interface**: Defines the common methods all signature types must implement
- **Validation Logic**: Ensures signatures are cryptographically valid and authorized
- **Authority Verification**: Checks that signers have the necessary authority
- **Threshold Evaluation**: Determines when signature thresholds are met
