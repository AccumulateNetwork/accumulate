## 1. Introduction

This document compares Accumulate's signature system with those of other major blockchain platforms, highlighting the unique features and advantages of Accumulate's approach. Understanding these differences helps developers and users leverage Accumulate's advanced signature capabilities effectively.

## 2. Overview of Signature Systems

### 2.1 Accumulate's Signature System

Accumulate uses a hierarchical, identity-centric approach:

- **Keybooks and Key Pages**: Hierarchical organization of keys
- **Multiple Signature Types**: Support for various cryptographic algorithms
- **Threshold Signatures**: Built-in multi-signature capabilities
- **Delegation**: Explicit delegation of signing authority
- **Identity Integration**: Tight integration with ADI (Accumulate Digital Identifier) system

The implementation in the codebase defines these signature types in `protocol/signature.go`:

```go
// From protocol/signature.go
const (
    SignatureTypeUnknown SignatureType = iota
    SignatureTypeLegacyED25519
    SignatureTypeED25519
    SignatureTypeRCD1
    SignatureTypeBTC
    SignatureTypeBTCLegacy
    SignatureTypeETH
    SignatureTypeDelegate
    SignatureTypeReceipt
    SignatureTypePartition
    SignatureTypeRemote
    SignatureTypeSynthetic
)
```

This extensive support for different signature types enables interoperability with various blockchain systems and cryptographic standards.

### 2.2 Common Signature Elements Across Blockchains

Most blockchain signature systems share these elements:

- **Public-Private Key Pairs**: Asymmetric cryptography for signatures
