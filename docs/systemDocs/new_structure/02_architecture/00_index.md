## 3. Architectural Principles

The Accumulate architecture is guided by several key principles:

- **Hierarchical Structure**: Accounts and identities are organized in a hierarchical manner
- **Separation of Concerns**: Different components have distinct responsibilities
- **Scalability**: The architecture is designed to scale with increasing usage
- **Security**: Security is built into every aspect of the design
- **Interoperability**: The system is designed to interoperate with other blockchains

## 4. System Components

The Accumulate system consists of several key components:

- **Block Validator Networks (BVNs)**: Process transactions and maintain state
- **Directory Network (DN)**: Coordinates between BVNs and maintains the global state
- **ADIs**: Provide identity and account management
- **Keybooks**: Manage keys and authorization
- **Anchoring System**: Secures the state through cross-chain anchoring
