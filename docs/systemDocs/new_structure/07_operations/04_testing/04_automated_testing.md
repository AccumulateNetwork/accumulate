# Accumulate Automated Testing

## 1. Introduction

This document describes the automated testing procedures used in the Accumulate project, including continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines. Automated testing is essential for maintaining code quality, preventing regressions, and enabling rapid, confident development.

## 2. Automated Testing Overview

### 2.1 Benefits of Automated Testing

Accumulate employs automated testing to achieve:

- **Consistency**: Tests run the same way every time
- **Speed**: Automated tests run faster than manual testing
- **Coverage**: Comprehensive testing of the codebase
- **Confidence**: Early detection of issues
- **Documentation**: Tests serve as executable documentation
- **Regression Prevention**: Catch regressions before they reach production

### 2.2 Types of Automated Tests

The Accumulate automated testing strategy includes:

1. **Unit Tests**: Testing individual components in isolation
2. **Integration Tests**: Testing interactions between components
3. **System Tests**: Testing end-to-end functionality
4. **Performance Tests**: Testing system performance
5. **Static Analysis**: Code quality and security checks
6. **Linting**: Code style and convention checks

## 3. CI/CD Pipeline

### 3.1 Pipeline Overview

The Accumulate CI/CD pipeline consists of several stages:

1. **Build**: Compile the code and create artifacts
2. **Test**: Run automated tests
3. **Analyze**: Perform static analysis and code quality checks
4. **Package**: Create deployment packages
5. **Deploy**: Deploy to test environments
6. **Validate**: Verify deployment and functionality

### 3.2 Pipeline Configuration

The CI/CD pipeline is configured using GitLab CI:

```yaml
# Example GitLab CI configuration (simplified)
stages:
  - build
  - test
  - analyze
  - package
  - deploy
  - validate

build:
  stage: build
  script:
    - make build

unit-tests:
  stage: test
  script:
    - make test

integration-tests:
  stage: test
  script:
    - make integration-test

static-analysis:
  stage: analyze
  script:
    - make lint
    - make vet

package:
  stage: package
  script:
    - make package

deploy-testnet:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - make deploy-testnet
  only:
    - main

validate-deployment:
  stage: validate
  script:
    - make validate-deployment
  only:
    - main
```

### 3.3 Pipeline Triggers

The CI/CD pipeline is triggered by:

- **Push to Repository**: Automatically on code push
- **Pull/Merge Requests**: When creating or updating PRs
- **Scheduled Runs**: Regular scheduled executions
- **Manual Triggers**: On-demand execution

## 4. Unit Testing

### 4.1 Unit Test Framework

Accumulate uses Go's built-in testing framework with extensions:

```go
import (
    "testing"
    "github.com/stretchr/testify/assert"
    "github.com/stretchr/testify/require"
)

func TestSomething(t *testing.T) {
    result := SomeFunctionToTest()
    assert.Equal(t, expectedValue, result)
}
```

### 4.2 Running Unit Tests

Unit tests can be run locally or in CI:

```bash
# Run all unit tests
go test ./...

# Run tests in a specific package
go test ./pkg/api/v3

# Run a specific test
go test ./pkg/api/v3 -run TestSpecificFunction

# Run tests with race detection
go test -race ./...

# Run tests with coverage
go test -cover ./...
```

### 4.3 Test Coverage

Code coverage is tracked to ensure adequate testing:

```bash
# Generate coverage report
go test -coverprofile=coverage.out ./...

# View coverage in browser
go tool cover -html=coverage.out

# Check coverage percentage
go tool cover -func=coverage.out
```

Coverage reports are generated in CI and tracked over time.

## 5. Integration Testing

### 5.1 Integration Test Framework

Integration tests use the simulator to test component interactions:

```go
import (
    "testing"
    "gitlab.com/accumulatenetwork/accumulate/test/simulator"
)

func TestIntegration(t *testing.T) {
    // Set up simulator
    sim := simulator.New(
        simulator.SimpleNetwork(t.Name(), 3, 3),
        simulator.Genesis(time.Now()),
    )
    
    // Start the simulator
    err := sim.Start(context.Background())
    require.NoError(t, err)
    defer sim.Stop()
    
    // Run integration test
    // ...
}
```

### 5.2 Running Integration Tests

Integration tests are typically run in CI but can also be run locally:

```bash
# Run integration tests
go test ./test/integration

# Run with specific tags
go test -tags=integration ./...
```

### 5.3 Integration Test Environment

Integration tests run in a controlled environment:

- Simulated network with multiple partitions
- In-memory or temporary databases
- Controlled time progression
- Isolated from external dependencies

## 6. System Testing

### 6.1 System Test Framework

System tests validate end-to-end functionality:

```go
func TestEndToEnd(t *testing.T) {
    // Set up test environment
    env := setupTestEnvironment(t)
    defer env.Cleanup()
    
    // Create accounts
    alice := createTestAccount(t, env, "alice")
    bob := createTestAccount(t, env, "bob")
    
    // Execute transaction
    txid := sendTokens(t, env, alice, bob, 100)
    
    // Verify result
    receipt := waitForTransaction(t, env, txid)
    assert.Equal(t, protocol.TxStatusSuccess, receipt.Status)
    
    // Verify account state
    aliceBalance := getAccountBalance(t, env, alice)
    bobBalance := getAccountBalance(t, env, bob)
    // Assert expected balances
}
```

### 6.2 Automated System Test Execution

System tests are executed:

- On a schedule (nightly or weekly)
- Before major releases
- After significant changes to core components

### 6.3 System Test Reporting

System test results are:

- Recorded in test management systems
- Analyzed for trends
- Used to inform release decisions
- Shared with the development team

## 7. Performance Testing

### 7.1 Performance Test Framework

Performance tests measure system performance:

```go
func BenchmarkTransactionThroughput(b *testing.B) {
    // Set up benchmark environment
    env := setupBenchmarkEnvironment(b)
    defer env.Cleanup()
    
    // Reset timer to exclude setup time
    b.ResetTimer()
    
    // Run benchmark
    for i := 0; i < b.N; i++ {
        // Execute transaction
        txid := submitBenchmarkTransaction(b, env)
        waitForTransaction(b, env, txid)
    }
}
```

### 7.2 Performance Metrics

Key performance metrics include:

- **Transactions per Second**: Maximum throughput
- **Latency**: Time to process transactions
- **Resource Usage**: CPU, memory, disk, network
- **Scalability**: Performance with increasing load
- **Stability**: Performance over time

### 7.3 Automated Performance Testing

Performance tests are run:

- On a schedule (weekly or monthly)
- After performance-related changes
- Before major releases
- As part of capacity planning

## 8. Static Analysis and Linting

### 8.1 Static Analysis Tools

Accumulate uses several static analysis tools:

- **Go Vet**: Analyzes code for suspicious constructs
- **Staticcheck**: Advanced static analyzer
- **Gosec**: Security-focused static analyzer
- **Errcheck**: Ensures errors are checked
- **Ineffassign**: Detects ineffective assignments

```bash
# Run static analysis
go vet ./...
staticcheck ./...
gosec ./...
```

### 8.2 Linting

Code style and conventions are enforced through linting:

- **Golint**: Basic linter
- **Gofmt**: Code formatter
- **Revive**: Configurable linter

```bash
# Run linters
golint ./...
gofmt -s -w .
revive ./...
```

### 8.3 Automated Code Quality Checks

Code quality checks are integrated into CI:

- Fail builds on critical issues
- Generate reports for non-critical issues
- Track quality metrics over time
- Enforce code review requirements

## 9. Test Data Management

### 9.1 Test Data Generation

Test data is generated using:

- **Fixtures**: Predefined test data
- **Factories**: Dynamic test data generation
- **Fakers**: Realistic random data
- **Snapshots**: Captured production data (anonymized)

```go
// Example of a test data factory
func createTestAccount(t *testing.T, env *TestEnv, name string) *protocol.LiteIdentity {
    key := acctesting.GenerateKey(name)
    account, err := protocol.LiteTokenAccountFromKey(key, protocol.ACME)
    require.NoError(t, err)
    
    // Fund the account
    err = env.Faucet.FundAccount(account.Url(), protocol.NewAmount(1000, 0))
    require.NoError(t, err)
    
    return account
}
```

### 9.2 Test Database Management

Test databases are managed through:

- **Seeding**: Populating with initial data
- **Cleaning**: Removing test data after tests
- **Isolation**: Ensuring test independence
- **Versioning**: Managing database schema changes

### 9.3 Test Environment Reset

Test environments are reset between test runs:

- In-memory databases are recreated
- Persistent databases are cleaned or reset
- State is initialized to a known baseline
- External dependencies are mocked or reset
