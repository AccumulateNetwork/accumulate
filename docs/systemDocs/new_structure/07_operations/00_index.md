## 1. Introduction

This section provides documentation on operating and maintaining an Accumulate network. It covers monitoring, performance optimization, and troubleshooting procedures for node operators and system administrators.

## 2. Available Topics

### Monitoring
Documentation on monitoring the health and performance of Accumulate nodes and networks.

### Performance
Information on optimizing the performance of Accumulate nodes and networks.

### Troubleshooting
Guides for diagnosing and resolving common issues with Accumulate nodes and networks.

## 3. Operational Considerations

When operating an Accumulate network, several key considerations should be kept in mind:

- **Resource Requirements**: CPU, memory, disk, and network requirements for nodes
- **Backup and Recovery**: Procedures for backing up and recovering node data
- **Security**: Best practices for securing nodes and networks
- **Scaling**: Strategies for scaling the network to handle increased load
- **Maintenance**: Procedures for routine maintenance and updates

## 4. Monitoring and Alerting

Effective monitoring and alerting are essential for maintaining a healthy Accumulate network. Key metrics to monitor include:

- **Node Health**: CPU, memory, disk usage, and network connectivity
- **Consensus Status**: Participation in consensus and block production
- **Transaction Processing**: Transaction throughput and latency
- **Error Rates**: Frequency and types of errors
- **Network Connectivity**: Peer connections and network topology

## 5. Healing Process

The healing process is a critical component of Accumulate operations, ensuring data consistency across the network:

- **Synthetic Healing**: Ensures synthetic transactions are properly propagated
- **Anchor Healing**: Verifies and repairs anchor chains
- **On-Demand Transaction Fetching**: Retrieves missing transactions when needed
