## Comparison with Original Structure

This new structure offers several advantages over the original:

1. **Logical Organization**: Documentation is organized by purpose and topic
2. **Reduced Duplication**: Overlapping content has been consolidated
3. **Improved Navigation**: Clear hierarchy makes finding information easier
4. **Focused Files**: Each file focuses on a specific topic, making it easier to understand
5. **AI-Friendly**: Smaller, more targeted files are easier for AI systems to process

## How to Use This Documentation

Start with the [main index](./00_index.md) to get an overview of the documentation structure. Then navigate to the specific section that addresses your needs. Each section has its own index file that provides an overview of the topics covered in that section.

## Next Steps

This reorganized structure is provided for review alongside the original structure. After review, it can either replace the original structure or be further refined based on feedback.
