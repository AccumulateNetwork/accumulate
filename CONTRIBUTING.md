# Contributing

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue,
email, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change.

Please note we have a code of conduct, please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Submitting Changes

+ When you are ready to submit your work, create a Pull Request on GitHub
  merging your branch into `develop`. If you are a core team member, your branch
  name must be or begin with the Jira task. For example,
  `AC-123-anon-account-tx`.
+ The pull request description must clearly describe the changes made. If the
  changes affect functionality, the description must include how the changes can
  be verified. Otherwise, the description must state that the changes do not
  affect functionality.

## Reviewing Changes

+ In general, a pull request should receive at least some constructive
  criticism, in the form of a requested change - everyone has room for
  improvement.
+ **The most important aspects to consider when reviewing changes are
  readability and verification.**
+ A pull request must be small enough that it can be reasonably reviewed. If the
  request is too large, ask the author to split the changes into multiple pull
  requests.
+ If the code is difficult to read, leave a comment. This could be a request to
  add additional comments, or to rewrite a function in a more readable way.
+ If the code is not verified or verifiable, leave a comment. This could be a
  request to add unit tests, or to rewrite a function in a more testable way, or
  it could be a comment that the reviewer was unable to debug the changes.
