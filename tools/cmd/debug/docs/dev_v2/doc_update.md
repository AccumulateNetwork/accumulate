# Documentation Update Plan for Transaction Healing Process

## Overview
This document outlines the plan for updating the transaction healing process documentation to ensure it is comprehensive, accurate, and aligned with the current implementation. The plan is divided into phases to allow for systematic updates and reviews.

## Phase 1: URL Standardization Documentation
1. **Create URL Construction Standards Section**
   - Document the standardized approach (raw partition URLs)
   - Include examples of correct URL formats
   - Explain the rationale for standardization
   - Add code examples showing proper URL construction

2. **Update Existing URL References**
   - Review all URL examples in the document
   - Ensure consistency with the standardized approach
   - Remove or update any references to the deprecated approach

## Phase 2: Transaction Reuse Documentation
1. **Document Transaction Reuse Mechanism**
   - Explain how existing transactions are reused
   - Detail the submission count tracking
   - Describe the decision process for reuse vs. creation
   - Document the transition to synthetic transactions after multiple failures

## Phase 3: Implementation Details
1. **Error Recovery Mechanisms**
   - Document specific error types and recovery approaches
   - Add flow diagrams for error handling
   - Include examples of common errors and resolution paths

2. **Integration with Existing Systems**
   - Document how healing interacts with the main blockchain
   - Clarify boundaries and interfaces
   - Add sequence diagrams showing interaction flows

## Phase 4: Configuration and Testing
1. **Configuration Guide**
   - Create comprehensive parameter documentation
   - Include default values and acceptable ranges
   - Provide recommendations for different network sizes

2. **Testing Strategy**
   - Document test approach and methodology
   - Include example test cases
   - Add validation criteria for successful healing

## Phase 5: Cleanup and Consolidation
1. **Remove Redundancies**
   - Identify and consolidate duplicate information
   - Ensure consistent terminology throughout

2. **Update Flow Diagrams**
   - Ensure all diagrams reflect the current implementation
   - Add missing steps or decision points

3. **Final Review**
   - Verify all sections are consistent with implementation
   - Check for any remaining gaps or inconsistencies

## Implementation Timeline
- Phase 1: URL Standardization Documentation - 1 day
- Phase 2: Caching System Documentation - 1 day
- Phase 3: Implementation Details - 2 days
- Phase 4: Configuration and Testing - 1 day
- Phase 5: Cleanup and Consolidation - 1 day

## Success Criteria
The documentation update will be considered complete when:
1. All phases have been implemented
2. The documentation accurately reflects the current implementation
3. All identified gaps have been addressed
4. The documentation has been reviewed and approved by the team
