## DEVELOPMENT PLAN: NEW HEALING IMPLEMENTATION (V3)

---

## Overview

This document outlines the development plan for a new healing implementation (v3) that builds upon the learnings from heal_v1 and dev_v2. The new implementation will be entirely contained within the `new_heal` package and will not modify any existing healing code.

## Goals

1. Create a more efficient and reliable healing process
2. Implement proper caching to reduce redundant network requests
3. Standardize URL construction for anchor healing
4. Improve error handling and reporting
5. Provide better monitoring and status reporting

## Implementation Structure

The new healing implementation will be organized as follows:

```
tools/cmd/debug/
├── new_heal.go                 # Main entry point for the new-heal command
└── new_heal/                   # Package containing all new healing implementation
    ├── status.go               # Status reporting subcommand
    ├── cache.go                # Caching implementation
    ├── anchor.go               # Anchor healing implementation
    ├── synth.go                # Synthetic healing implementation
    ├── common.go               # Common utilities and structures
    └── ...                     # Additional files as needed
```

## Key Improvements from Previous Versions

### 1. Caching System

Building on the learnings from v2, we will implement a robust caching system that:

- Stores query results in a map indexed by URL and query type
- Avoids repeated queries for the same data
- Tracks problematic nodes to avoid querying them for certain types of requests
- Implements proper cache invalidation strategies

### 2. URL Construction Standardization

Addressing the inconsistency identified in v2:

- Standardize on one approach for URL construction
- Ensure all code that constructs or queries anchor URLs is consistent
- Update all related code to be aware of the correct URL format
- Add comprehensive tests to verify URL consistency

### 3. Error Handling

Improvements to error handling:

- Prevent nil pointer dereferences when marshaling nil records
- Convert nil records to proper errors with descriptive messages
- Allow calling code to handle errors gracefully
- Implement retries with exponential backoff for transient failures

### 4. In-Memory Database

Leveraging the in-memory database implementation documented in v2:

- Use simplified key-value operations
- Implement batch operations for efficiency
- Leverage existing Accumulate key construction functions
- Ensure thread safety with appropriate locking mechanisms

## Implementation Phases

1. **Phase 1: Core Infrastructure**
   - Set up the basic command structure
   - Implement the caching system
   - Create the in-memory database

2. **Phase 2: Healing Logic**
   - Implement anchor healing with standardized URL construction
   - Implement synthetic healing with improved throughput
   - Add comprehensive error handling

3. **Phase 3: Monitoring and Reporting**
   - Implement status reporting
   - Add metrics collection
   - Create visualization tools for healing progress

## Next Steps

1. Complete the command structure setup
2. Begin implementation of the caching system
3. Develop the standardized URL construction approach
4. Implement the core healing logic
