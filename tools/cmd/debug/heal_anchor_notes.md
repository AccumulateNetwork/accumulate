# Heal Anchor Output Formatting Notes

## Issue: Anchor Healing Output Format

The anchor healing process was previously displaying output in a non-tabular format, making it difficult to read and interpret. The output looked like this:

```

```

## Solution: Implementing Proper Table Format

The issue was identified in the `heal_common.go` file where the output was being generated using individual print statements rather than a structured table format. The solution involved:

1. Adding the tablewriter package import to `heal_common.go`
2. Replacing the individual print statements with a proper table format using tablewriter
3. Structuring the data into columns for better readability

### Implementation Details

The code was modified to create a table with the following columns:
- Source: The source partition
- Destination: The destination partition
- Status: Visual indicator (âœ“, ðŸ—´, or âš ) of the anchor status
- Pending: Number of pending anchors
- Source Height: The current height of the source chain (Last Processed + Pending)
- Dest Height: The height of the last processed anchor on the destination
- Unprocessed: Number of unprocessed anchors
- Range: Range of unprocessed anchors (start â†’ end)

### Benefits of the Table Format

1. **Improved Readability**: The tabular format makes it easier to scan and interpret the data
2. **Structured Information**: Each piece of information has its own column, making it clear what each value represents
3. **Consistent Formatting**: The table provides consistent spacing and alignment for all entries
4. **Visual Indicators**: Status symbols (âœ“, ðŸ—´, âš ) provide quick visual cues about the state of each anchor

## Additional Changes

In addition to the table formatting, we also made changes to ensure that charts and detailed outputs are printed only after the healing process is complete, rather than during the execution. This involved:

1. Removing the table printing from the `healAnchors` function in `heal_anchor.go`
2. Ensuring all data is collected and stored in the `missingAnchors` map
3. Printing the comprehensive summary table at the end of the healing process

## Differences Between sequence.go and heal_anchor.go

There are several key differences between the two files that affect how anchor data is processed:

1. **URL Construction**:
   - `sequence.go` uses raw partition URLs for tracking (e.g., `acc://bvn-Apollo.acme`)
   - `heal_anchor.go` now also uses the same approach with `protocol.PartitionUrl(src.ID)` to create URLs

2. **Query Methods**:
   - Both files now use the `Private().Sequence()` method to fetch anchor entries
   - Both use the same approach for querying chain counts and entries

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Both files now implement similar error handling for peer unavailability
   - Both track problematic nodes to avoid querying them for certain types of requests

4. **Caching System**:
   - `heal_anchor.go` implements a caching system to store query results
   - This reduces redundant network requests and improves performance

5. **Output Format**:
   - `sequence.go` uses individual print statements with color coding
   - `heal_anchor.go` now collects data during processing and displays it in a tablewriter format at the end

These changes ensure consistency across the codebase, particularly in how URLs are constructed and how anchor data is retrieved, while also providing a more readable and comprehensive output format.
