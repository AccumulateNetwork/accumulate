# Enhanced Network Discovery Test Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive test plan for the enhanced network discovery implementation. The test plan is divided into phases that align with the implementation phases of the enhanced network discovery feature.

## Phase 1: Basic Functionality Tests

### Unit Tests

1. **Address Collection Tests**
   - Test `collectValidatorAddresses` function
   - Verify all address types are collected (P2P, IP, RPC, API, Metrics)
   - Test with various validator configurations

2. **Address Validation Tests**
   - Test `validateAddress` function
   - Verify validation logic for each address type
   - Test with valid and invalid addresses

3. **URL Standardization Tests**
   - Test `standardizeURL` function
   - Verify consistent URL construction
   - Test with different URL types (partition, anchor, API)

4. **API v3 Connectivity Tests**
   - Test `testAPIv3Connectivity` function
   - Verify connectivity checks work correctly
   - Test with available and unavailable endpoints

### Integration Tests

1. **Discovery Process Integration**
   - Test the complete discovery process with mock services
   - Verify all components work together correctly
   - Test with various network configurations

2. **Error Handling**
   - Test error handling during the discovery process
   - Verify the system is resilient to failures
   - Test with simulated network errors

3. **Performance Testing**
   - Test discovery performance with a large number of validators
   - Measure discovery time and resource usage
   - Identify potential bottlenecks

## Phase 2: End-to-End Tests

1. **Mainnet Discovery Test**
   - Test against the actual mainnet
   - Verify all validators are discovered
   - Verify all address types are collected
   - Verify URL standardization works correctly

2. **Comparison with Network Status**
   - Compare discovery results with network status command
   - Verify consistency between the two methods
   - Identify any discrepancies

3. **Consensus Checking**
   - Test consensus status checking
   - Verify "zombie" node detection
   - Test with nodes in various states

## Phase 3: Validation and Verification

1. **URL Consistency Tests**
   - Test URL construction consistency across components
   - Verify anchor URLs are constructed correctly
   - Compare with existing implementation

2. **Network Status Command Comparison**
   - Run the network status command
   - Compare results with enhanced discovery
   - Verify all information is consistent

3. **Long-Running Stability Tests**
   - Test discovery over extended periods
   - Verify stability with network changes
   - Test with various network conditions

## Phase 4: Comprehensive Testing

1. **Regression Testing**
   - Verify existing functionality still works
   - Test backward compatibility
   - Ensure no regressions in related components

2. **Edge Case Testing**
   - Test with unusual network configurations
   - Test with network partitions
   - Test with mixed validator versions

3. **Final Validation**
   - Comprehensive validation of all features
   - Verify all requirements are met
   - Final performance and stability testing

## Test Execution

Tests will be executed in the following order:

1. Unit tests during development
2. Integration tests after basic functionality is complete
3. End-to-end tests on test networks
4. Validation tests on mainnet (with appropriate safeguards)
5. Comprehensive testing before final release

## Test Reporting

Test results will be documented with:
- Pass/fail status for each test
- Performance metrics
- Any issues or anomalies discovered
- Recommendations for improvements

## Conclusion

This test plan provides a comprehensive approach to testing the enhanced network discovery implementation. By following this plan, we can ensure that the implementation meets all requirements and functions correctly in all scenarios.
